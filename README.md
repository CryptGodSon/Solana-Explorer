# Solana-Explorer
Python program that uses the Solana API to explore transactions in the Solana blockchain


# How to use ?
To use this program, you'll need to replace the INSERT_TRANSACTION_ID_HERE placeholder with the ID of the transaction you want to explore. You can find transaction IDs on Solana block explorers like Solscan or Solana Beach.

When you run the program, it will print out the sender, recipient, and amount of the specified transaction. You can modify the program to explore other details of the transaction or to explore transactions in a different way.

Note that this program assumes you're exploring transactions on the Solana mainnet. If you're exploring transactions on a testnet, you'll need to use a different Solana RPC endpoint.

# Python Version

This code should work with the latest version of Python (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021). However, if you encounter any errors or issues, let me know and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot them!
